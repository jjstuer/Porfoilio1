<p>
    <h3>1. Notting Hill</h3>
</p>
<p>
    Starring Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts. Notting Hill is about a humble travel book store owner (Hugh GranT) that finds himself dating or seeing a very popular actress (Julia Roberts)from the United States.  This is a comedy romance or romantic comedy (Rom-Com). It is very good just to watch this either by yourself or with someone that you have an invested interest in.

    <h3>2. U.S. Marshall's</h3> 
</p>

<p>
Starring Tom Lee Jones and Wesly Snipes.  U.S. Marshall's is a side movie that was made from the movie called "The Fugitive" (which was a tv show with the same title, that was made poplar from the 1960's). U.S. MArshall Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) is after a fugitive (Wesly Snipes) who is an ex CIA Operative that is being framed by CCP Spy.  Thiws is a nail biting, "keep you on the edge of your seat" action movie.  Well worth it.  Infact, I love this movie so much, that I ended up buying the movie poster for it.

    <h3>3. Avatar</h3>
</p>

<p>
    Starring Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana.  In this very long 3 hour film made with a lot animation and other computer generatged images, A former and disabled Marine name Corporal Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) finds adventure and a purpose to fight for, when he meets a indiginous humanoid being name Neytiri (Zoe Saldana).  Jake and Neytiri advetures continue in their next movie.  this is a Sci-Fi movie to the max!  If you are going to watch it, then it is must bring snacks or a lunch, plenty beverages, and a remote to pause the movie to take a break.
